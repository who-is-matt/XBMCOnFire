XBMCForFireTV
=============

XBMC For Fire TV is designed to provide Amazon Fire TV users easier access to installed versions of the popular XBMC Media Center, which complements the Fire TV's impressive Internet streaming capabilities with local media streaming.  When installed from the Amazon App Store, XBMC For Fire TV allows developers and other users to launch sideloaded versions of XBMC (including XBMC Gotham, SPMC, and XBMC For Ouya) from the Fire TV's App menu rather than the Settings > Applications menu.

NOTE: XBMC For Fire TV is a launcher only and does *not* install XBMC.  Users must install XBMC on the Fire TV themselves in order to use the XBMC For Fire TV app.  Instructions for installing XBMC on the Fire TV can be found on the Amazon Fire TV page of the XBMC wiki.  http://wiki.xbmc.org/index.php?title=Amazon_Fire_TV
